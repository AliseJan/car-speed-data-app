# car-speed-data-app
This web application is a full-stack solution designed to manage and analyze vehicle speed data. Built with ASP.NET Core and React (using TypeScript), it provides a seamless interface for data storage, retrieval, and visualization using a SQL database. Users can upload speed data through a text file, clear existing entries, and employ comprehensive filters for data display.

### Key Features:

- File Upload: Allows for the bulk upload of vehicle speed data (date, speed, registration number) via a .txt file format.
- Data Management: Offers functionality to clear all data from the SQL database with a single action.
- Data Display: Data is presented in a user-friendly table format, with support for filtering by speed range and date range. Pagination is implemented for easy navigation.
- Graph Functionality: Users can visualize the average speed per hour through an interactive graph for any selected date, enhancing data analysis.
- Unit Testing: Includes a suite of unit tests for the backend to ensure reliability and performance.
